        <h3>For this lesson, you'll need the following:</h3>
        <ul class="lis-style-type:disc">
            <li>Microsoft Excel</li>
            <li>PASW (formerly SPSS) statistics software, or free trial download</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>You should already be familiar with:</h3>
        <ul class="lis-style-type:disc">
            <li>The basic functions and tools of Excel
            <li>Descriptive statistics and inferential statistics</li>

            undegraduate students undertaking original reserarch projects. 
            After completing the 30-minute lesson, you will be able to:</h3>
        <ul class="lis-style-type:disc">
            <li>Format raw research data in an Excel spreadsheet for efficient analysis</li>
            <li>Run basic descriptive statistics in Excel</li>
            <li>Prepare the document for statistical analysis in the software package PASW</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Format Data for Analysis</h2>
        <p>
            Make sure the computer you are working on has Microsoft Excel installed. Open the document 
            <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9JV8LwS9NL0">ToolBox_DataLesson.xls</a> in Excel and 
            follow along with the lesson. taking action as instructed. In the Raw_Dataset spreadsheet, the name 
            of each variable has been entered in the first row of each column.
        </p>

        <ol>
            <li>Each variable name must be different from other variable names</li>
            <li>The first variable (in column A) is a <b>unique identifier.</b></li>
            <li>Variable names must start with a letter (not numbers or special characters), so change
                <em>tutorial_types to tutorial_types.</em></li>
            <li>Name variables so that they are intuitive to you. Therefore, change <em>use</em> and <em>useful to
                perc_ease_of_use and perc_usefulness,</em> respectively.</li>
            <li>Your spreadsheet should look like Figure 1, and it should now be readily apparent that
                Column F refers to <em>Perceived Usefulness</em> and Column G refers to <em>Perceived Ease of
                Use.</em></li>
        </ol>

        <figure>
            <img src="../images/datalesson_fig3.png" alt="Figure 1: raw dataset sheet with category variable names">
        <figcaption>
            Tutorial type, gender, experience, and task categorial values have been 
            formatted as dichotomous variables
        </figcaption>
        </figure>

        <p>
            Data values, or rows, have been input for each subject in the experiment
        </p>

        <ol>
            <li>Decide on input conventions and stick to them. In <em>gender</em>, change the "female" value 
                to "F".</li>
            <li>Separate data into component values whenever possible by adding new columns. For example, 
                tasks_completed values (Y/Y/N) can be broken up into three components. So, add columns <em>task1, 
                task2,</em> and <em>task3,</em> and reformat values appropriately.</li>
            <li>Double-check to ensure no data entry errors have been made, then delete the old
                tasks_completed column.</li>
            <li>Your Raw_Dataset spreadsheet should now look like Figure 2.</li>
        </ol>

            <img src="../image/datalesson_fig2.png" alt="Figure 2: raw dataset sheet with data entered for each subject">
        <figcaption>Values for each variable are entered in a consistent format</figcaption>
        </figure>
        <h3>Formatting data for analysis</h3>
        <p>
            Replace categorical data values with "0" or "1" (0=no, 1=yes) to indicate whether or not the
            value is represented for the given subject/item. This makes the categorical values
            dichotomous, which gives the researcher maximum flexibility in testing for relationships or
            correlations.
        </p>

        <ol>
            <li>Copy the Raw_Dataset values into the Sheet2 tab. Rename this sheet Formatted_Data.</li>
            <li>In the Formatted_Data sheet, add new columns with <b>Insert > Columns</b> for each 
                distinct value in categorical data columns (tutorial_types, gender, exp_level, task1, task2, 
                and task3). You do not have to add a new column for task1, task2, and task3 because their
                values are already dichotomous.
            </li>
            <li>Rename columns according to each possible categorical value. Copy and paste the values 
                from the original column.</li>
            <li>Replace dichotomous data values with "0" or "1" (0=no, 1=yes) using the replace
                function: <b>Edit > Replace.</b></li>
            <li>Your Formatted_Data spreadsheet should now look like Figure 3.</li>
        </ol>

            0 and 1 for representation">
            <figcaption>Tutorial type, experience, and task categorical values have been formatted as dichotomous variables.</figcaption>
        </figure>
        
        <h3>Run Descriptive Statistics</h3>
        <aside class="sidebar">
            Analyzing descriptive statistics may lead you to ask new questions. For example, <em>
            perc_enjoy</em> is much higher on average than <em>perc_usefulness</em>, which also has a large
            variance. This suggests that a segment of users may not have considered the system useful even though they enjoyed using it.
        </aside>

        <h2>Run Descriptive Statistics</h2>
        <p>
            Run descriptive (summary) statistics on the dataset and output results in a new spreadsheet. If
            necessary, rearrange columns so that data requiring summary, those with continuous values,
            are adjacent. (In the spreadsheet, the continuous values of <em>perc_enjoy, perc_usefulness, and
            perc_ease_of_use</em> are already adjacent.) Write down the "input range" (i.e. H2:J26) of the data
            requiring summary, making sure not to include variable labels.
        </p>
        <p>
            Add-Ins... and make sure Analysis ToolPak is checked. Click OK.
            2. Go to Tools > Data Analysis and select Descriptive Statistics. Click OK.
            3. Enter the input range in the blank and check Summary Statistics. Click OK. -->
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>Go to <b>Tools > Add-Ins...</b> and make sure <b>Analysis ToolPak</b> is checked. Click OK.</li>
            <li>Go to <b>Tools > Data Analysis</b> and select <b>Descriptive Statistics.</b> Click OK.</li>
            <li>Enter the input range in the blank and check <b>Summary Statistics.</b> Click OK.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            The descriptive statistics summary will output in a new sheet. Rename this spreadsheet
            Descriptive_Stats. Label the output according to the variables. For example, Column 1 should
            be perc_enjoy. Your Descriptive_Stats spreadsheet should now look like Figure 4. Analyzing descriptive statistics 
            is a great way to start appraising a dataset before running
            inferential statistics. What insights about the dataset can you glean from the summary statistics
        </p>

            <figcaption>Excel will not run descriptive statistics with non-numeric characters, so the variable labels must be re-entered.</figcaption>
        </figure>

        <h2>Run Inferential Statistics</h2>
        <p>
            Open PASW and upload the spreadsheet. (IIT labs in Stuart Building, room 112, have PASW.
            You can also download a 30-day free trial.)
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>When PASW starts, it will prompt you for a data source. Select Open an existing data
                source > More Files...</li>
            <li>Set the file type to Excel, then find and open the file.</li>
            <li>From the list, select the Formatted_Data worksheet. Click OK. You should now see the dataset.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            The most commonly used statistical methods and tests are found under the Analyze menu in
            the standard toolbar. Figure 5 shows where to find some common statistical methods and tests. Under PASW's
            Analyze menu, see if you can also find the following:
        </p>

        <ol>
            <li>Wilcoxon-Mann-Whitney test</li>
            <li>Simple linear regression</li>
            <li>Non-parametric correlation</li>
        </ol>

        <p>
            You should have determined that the Kruskal-Wallis one-way analysis of variance is the
            appropriate test. Go to <b>Analyze > Nonparametric Tests > K Independent Samples...</b> A new
            window will open prompting you to select the variables (by column name) to be tested.
        </p>

        <ol>
            <li>Select the <em>perc_usefulness</em> variable from the scrollable list on the left, and click the top arrow to move it to the Test Variable List 
                (i.e. dependent variable).</li>
            <li>Select the <em>free_play</em> variable from the scrollable list, and click the bottom arrow to move it to the Grouping Variable section 
                (i.e. independent variable).</li>
            <li>Click <b>Define Range...</b>, and enter "0" in the Minimum field and "1" in the Maximum field. This specifies the two categorical variables 
                to be tested. Your screen should now look

        <p>
            Click OK to display the statistical analysis results to new viewing window. Your results screen should look like Figure 7. 
            Because statistical analysis output contains many numerical components (some of which must be cited in formal reports), 
            it is a good idea to save it to a format independent of the PASW software. To save the results, go to <b>File > Export.</b> 
        </p>
        <p>
            Change Document Type to the desired output format (Word, Excel, PDF, etc.), then click OK.
